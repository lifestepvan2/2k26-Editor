## Project Docs First
- Before making changes, read the project documentation to understand intent, workflows, and constraints.
- Start with `README.md`, then read all additional md files.
- Check each top-level folder for `README.md` or other docs and skim any that match the area you plan to edit.
Ignore the all top level folders besides nba2k_editor.
