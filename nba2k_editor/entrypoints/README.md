# entrypoints folder## Responsibilities- GUI, RL hook, and extraction command entry orchestration.- Owns direct Python files: `__init__.py`, `editor_train_hook.py`, `extract_cba_rules.py`, `full_editor.py`, `gui.py`, `train_gm_agent.py`.- Maintains folder-local runtime behavior and boundaries used by the editor.## Technical Deep DiveGUI, RL hook, and extraction command entry orchestration.This folder currently has 6 direct Python modules. Function-tree coverage below is exhaustive for direct files and includes nested callables.## Runtime/Data Flow1. Callers enter this folder through public entry modules or imported helper functions.2. Folder code performs domain-specific orchestration and delegates to adjacent layers as needed.3. Results/events/state are returned to UI, model, runtime, or CLI callers depending on workflow.## Integration Points- Bridges startup into `core`, `memory`, `models`, and `ui`.- CLI flows hand off into `nba2k_editor/gm_rl` and extraction modules.## Function Tree### `__init__.py`- No callable definitions.### `editor_train_hook.py`- [def] editor_train_hook.py::run_training_from_editor### `extract_cba_rules.py`- [def] extract_cba_rules.py::_default_source- [def] extract_cba_rules.py::_default_outdir- [def] extract_cba_rules.py::main### `full_editor.py`- [def] full_editor.py::_parse_indices_csv- [def] full_editor.py::parse_editor_request- [def] full_editor.py::_build_model- [def] full_editor.py::_resolve_team_name- [def] full_editor.py::_open_requested_editor- [def] full_editor.py::_viewport_title- [def] full_editor.py::main### `gui.py`- [def] gui.py::_cleanup_enabled- [def] gui.py::_delete_runtime_cache_dirs- [def] gui.py::_print_offsets_status- [def] gui.py::_launch_with_dearpygui- [def] gui.py::main### `train_gm_agent.py`- No callable definitions.## Failure Modes and Debugging- Upstream schema or dependency drift can surface runtime failures in this layer.- Environment mismatches (platform, optional deps, file paths) can reduce or disable functionality.- Nested call paths are easiest to diagnose by following this README function tree and runtime logs.## Test Coverage Notes- Coverage for this folder is provided by related suites under `nba2k_editor/tests`.- Use targeted pytest runs around impacted modules after edits.
