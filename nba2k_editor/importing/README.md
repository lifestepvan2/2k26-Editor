# importing folder## Responsibilities- Excel import/export mapping and workflow implementation.- Owns direct Python files: `__init__.py`, `excel_import.py`.- Maintains folder-local runtime behavior and boundaries used by the editor.## Technical Deep DiveExcel import/export mapping and workflow implementation.This folder currently has 2 direct Python modules. Function-tree coverage below is exhaustive for direct files and includes nested callables.## Runtime/Data Flow1. Callers enter this folder through public entry modules or imported helper functions.2. Folder code performs domain-specific orchestration and delegates to adjacent layers as needed.3. Results/events/state are returned to UI, model, runtime, or CLI callers depending on workflow.## Integration Points- Triggered from Excel workflows in `nba2k_editor/ui/app.py`.- Reads/writes through `nba2k_editor/models/data_model.py`.## Function Tree### `__init__.py`- No callable definitions.### `excel_import.py`  - [def] excel_import.py::_RecordSnapshot.record_view- [def] excel_import.py::_build_player_snapshot- [def] excel_import.py::_decode_string_from_record- [def] excel_import.py::_decode_float_from_record- [def] excel_import.py::_decode_bits_from_record- [def] excel_import.py::_decode_field_value_from_record  - [def] excel_import.py::ImportResult.summary_text  - [def] excel_import.py::ExportResult.summary_text- [def] excel_import.py::template_path_for- [def] excel_import.py::_ensure_openpyxl- [def] excel_import.py::_sanitize_excel_value- [def] excel_import.py::_header_text- [def] excel_import.py::_field_text- [def] excel_import.py::_header_candidates- [def] excel_import.py::_preferred_categories- [def] excel_import.py::_build_field_lookup- [def] excel_import.py::_resolve_version_key- [def] excel_import.py::_augment_with_display_aliases- [def] excel_import.py::_map_headers- [def] excel_import.py::_find_column- [def] excel_import.py::_resolve_row_name- [def] excel_import.py::_build_row_key_map- [def] excel_import.py::_row_has_values- [def] excel_import.py::_resolve_player- [def] excel_import.py::_resolve_named_index- [def] excel_import.py::import_excel_workbook- [def] excel_import.py::export_excel_workbook- [def] excel_import.py::import_players_from_excel- [def] excel_import.py::import_teams_from_excel- [def] excel_import.py::import_staff_from_excel- [def] excel_import.py::import_stadiums_from_excel- [def] excel_import.py::export_players_to_excel- [def] excel_import.py::export_teams_to_excel- [def] excel_import.py::export_staff_to_excel- [def] excel_import.py::export_stadiums_to_excel## Failure Modes and Debugging- Upstream schema or dependency drift can surface runtime failures in this layer.- Environment mismatches (platform, optional deps, file paths) can reduce or disable functionality.- Nested call paths are easiest to diagnose by following this README function tree and runtime logs.## Test Coverage Notes- Coverage for this folder is provided by related suites under `nba2k_editor/tests`.- Use targeted pytest runs around impacted modules after edits.
